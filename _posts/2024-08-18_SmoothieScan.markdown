# Project Map
- Scan each recipe in the magazine
- Use Google OCR API to scrape the text from each image
- Use python regex interpretation to isolate useful information
- Create a CRUD searchable database using Ruby Rails
  
# Google OCR API implementation
Here is an excerpt of the python code which grabs the text from each scan:
```python

```

# Decode 
I also created the decoding side of the equation, which would be a fun way to pass messages between friends:
```python

```

Check out my github for the full code and more details on the project!
